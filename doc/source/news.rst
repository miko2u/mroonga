Release 2.05 - 2012/07/29

.. caution::

   This release has a backward incompatible change against SET column
   and ENUM.
   If you use SET column or ENUM that has the number of elements < 256
   in :doc:`/tutorial/storage`, please recreate (dump and restore)

Here is upgrade sequence.

Dump a database that uses mroonga::

  % mysqldump MY_MROONGA_DATABASE > database-mroonga.dump

Drop the existing database::

  % mysql -u root -e 'DROP DATABASE MY_MROONGA_DATABASE'

You must upgrade to "mroonga" storage engine. Use
``apt-get`` on Debian GNU/Linux or Ubuntu and ``yum`` on
CentOS or Fedora.

apt-get::

  % sudo apt-get install -y mysql-server-mroonga

yum (upgrade from mroonga release prior to v2.02)::

  % sudo yum remove -y mysql-mroonga
  % sudo yum install -y mysql-mroonga

yum (upgrade from mroonga release v2.03 or later)::

  % sudo yum install -y mysql-mroonga

.. caution::

   Don't forget to run ``yum remove`` before ``yum
   install`` if you upgrade mroonga prior to v2.02 release.
   If you forget to run ``yum remove``, we will break
   a MySQL's system table.

Recreate a database::

  % mysql -u root -e 'CREATE DATABASE MY_MROONGA_DATABASE'

Release 2.02 - 2012/04/29
-------------------------

.. caution::

   The package sign key is changed since this release. Import the new
   package sign key before updating groogna packages.

   Debian/Ubuntu::

     % sudo apt-get update
     % sudo apt-get -y --allow-unauthenticated install groonga-keyring

   CentOS/Fedora::

     % sudo yum install --nogpgcheck -y groonga-repository

.. caution::

   This release breaks a backward compatibility for ``ENUM`` type. If
   you have ``ENUM`` type and it has 256 or more values, you need to
   dump your table before upgrade and restore your table after
   upgrade.

.. caution::

   This release breaks a backward compatibility for ``SET`` type. If
   you have ``SET`` type and it has 32 or more values, you need to
   dump your table before upgrade and restore your table after
   upgrade.

Release 2.00 - 2012/02/29
-------------------------

.. caution::

   This release breaks backward compatibility. We need to
   dump and restore our database for upgrading.

In this release, mroonga has two changes that requires
database recreation:

1. Supported all characters for database, table and column
   names.
2. Groonga's native time data type is used for ``YEAR`` type
   in MySQL.

Here are upgrade sequence.

We dump a database that uses mroonga::

  % mysqldump MY_MROONGA_DATABASE > database-mroonga.dump

We drop the existing database::

  % mysql -u root -e 'DROP DATABASE MY_MROONGA_DATABASE'

We upgrade to "mroonga" storage engine. We will use
``apt-get`` on Debian GNU/Linux or Ubuntu and ``yum`` on
CentOS or Fedora.

apt-get::

  % sudo apt-get install -y mysql-server-mroonga

yum::

  % sudo yum remove -y mysql-mroonga
  % sudo yum install -y mysql-mroonga

.. caution::

   We don't forget to run ``yum remove`` before ``yum
   install``. If we forget to run ``yum remove``, we will break
   a MySQL's system table.

We recreate a database::

  % mysql -u root -e 'CREATE DATABASE MY_MROONGA_DATABASE'

We restore a database by modified dump file::

  % mysql -u root MY_MROONGA_DATABASE < database-mroonga.dump

Now, we can use mroonga 2.00.

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Supported MySQL 5.5.21.
* Required groonga 2.0.0 or later.
* Supported TIMESTAMP with fractional seconds on MySQL 5.6 and MariaDB.
* [storage mode] Supported ``ORDER LIMIT`` optimization on no primary key.

  groonga to improve groonga integration.

* [incompatible] Supported ``/`` in database name. [#1281]
* Suppressed needless messages on ``INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE
  KEY UPDATE``.
* Supported ``INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`` with
  ``UNIQUE KEY``. [#1283] [Reported by @104yuki_n]
* Supported ``DATETIME``, ``DATE``, ``TIMESTAMP``, ``TIME``,
  ``DECIMAL``, ``YEAR`` for primary key.
* [incompatible] Supported all characters for database, table and
  column names. [#1284]
* [wrapper mode] Supported 255 bytes over index. [#1282]
* [wrapper mode] Supported updating primary key. [#1195]
* [wrapper mode] Supported error handling on ``ALTER TABLE``. [#1195]

1. Storage engine name is changed to "mroonga" from "groonga".
2. Groonga's native time data type is used for DATE, DATETIME

We need to modify dumped database to change "ENGINE=groonga"
in "CREATE TABLE" SQL. Here are upgrade sequence.

We dump a database that uses mroonga::

  % mysqldump MY_MROONGA_DATABASE > database-groonga.dump

We convert storage engine in dump file::

  % sed -e 's/^) ENGINE=groonga/) ENGINE=mroonga/' database-groonga.dump > database-mroonga.dump

We confirm that ``ENGINE=groonga`` only in ``CREATE TABLE``
is replaced with ``ENGINE=mroonga``. We need to check ``@@
... @@`` line includes ``CREATE TABLE``. If the line
includes ``CREATE TABLE``, the hunk will be a change for
``CREATE TABLE``::
